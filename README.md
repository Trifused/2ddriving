### Project Overview: 2D Driving App

**Live Here:** [2D Driving App](https://2dziz.com)
This project draws inspiration from Frame Synthesis's 3D driving demo on Google Maps, reimagining it as a streamlined 2D experience. With the help of ChatGPT, other AI tools, and countless hours of effort (not to mention many headaches), this app simplifies the gameplay mechanics to transform the excitement of driving and racing into a fun, accessible, and engaging format—perfect for quick challenges or competitive play. Contributions from all are welcome as we continue to refine and expand this exciting project.
