# 🚗 2D ZiZ Driving App

🔗 **Live Here:** [2D Driving App](https://2dziz.com)  

Inspired by **Frame Synthesis's 3D driving demo**, this project reimagines the experience in a streamlined **2D format**. With the help of **ChatGPT**, **Copilot**, **DeepSeek**,  AI tools, and countless hours of effort (not to mention a few headaches! 😅),** this app brings an accessible and fun driving experience.
